    <div>The tournament is open to everyone, regardless of skill level. <br>

        In order to take part in the tournament, you must have an account on TETR.IO and satisfy these requirements:<br>
        • You must have played at least 15 games in TETRA LEAGUE (TL)<br>
        • You must have an RD value of no more than 100 (you must have a letter rank)<br>

        You must also join the tournament’s official Discord server for check-ins and have an account on smash.gg (since
        you'll be submitting your match results through this website).<br>

        These requirements will be checked only once when registration ends. However, if you leave the Discord server at
        any point during the tournament, VTT reserves the right to disqualify you from Comet Open.
