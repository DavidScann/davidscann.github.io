                domestic tourneys up til this point and Comet Open is our first appearance on the international

                playing in Comet open— hell, we hope you'll have a great time regardless of the tourney itself. Please refer
                to our Discord [ hyperlink this link for “our Discord” https://discord.gg/BsBCZRqKHp] for any criticism or
